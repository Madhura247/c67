Once, there was a monkey who lived on a berry tree. One day, a crocodile came to eat the berries from the tree. He liked the berries. They were very tasty. The next day, the crocodile came again and took some berries home for his wife. She too liked it. The monkey and the crocodile son became good friends. But the crocodile's wife was jealous of the monkey. She told her husband that if the berries are so tasty, how delicipus would the heart of the monkey be who eats these berries everyday? The crocodile was sad but he had to bring his friend.
